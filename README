air-quality-sensor - user space driver for AppliedSensor's Indoor Air Monitor

The Indoor Air Monitor is a USB flash drive-shaped sensor which measures the
surrounding's air pollution. This driver prints a list with all connected
sensors and their current values to the commandline. Brand names and further
information has been documented on http://wiki.micasaverde.com/index.php/
CO2_Sensor.

The air quality is displayed on the hardware token by three indicator lamps
with the colours green (= good), yellow (= average) and red (= bad), the same
colors are also printed by this tool.
